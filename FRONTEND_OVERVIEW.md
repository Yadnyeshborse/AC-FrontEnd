- Mobile-friendly layout

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**
```bash
Node.js (v14+)
Java Backend running on http://localhost:8080
```

### **Installation & Running**
```bash
cd daiken-frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 📱 User Interface Overview

### **Main Dashboard**
- Building title and statistics
- Target temperature control
- Add room and refresh buttons
- Grid layout of room cards

### **Room Cards**
- Room type icons (Home, Gym, Library, Laundry)
- Current temperature display
- Heating/cooling status indicators
- Edit and delete action buttons

### **Add Room Modal**
- Form for room details
- Type selection (Apartment/Common Room)
- Owner name for apartments
- Common room type selection
- Live preview of room card

## 🎨 Design Features

### **Visual Elements**
- **Color Coding**: Red for heating, blue for cooling, gray for idle
- **Icons**: Contextual icons for different room types
- **Gradients**: Modern gradient backgrounds
- **Cards**: Clean card-based layout with shadows

### **Responsive Design**
- Mobile-first approach
- Flexible grid layouts
- Collapsible navigation on small screens
- Touch-friendly interface elements

## 🔧 API Integration

### **Endpoints Used**
```javascript
GET    /api/building              // Get building details
PUT    /api/building/temperature  // Update target temperature
GET    /api/building/rooms        // Get all rooms
POST   /api/building/apartments   // Add apartment
POST   /api/building/common-rooms // Add common room
PUT    /api/building/rooms/{id}   // Update room
DELETE /api/building/rooms/{id}   // Delete room
```

### **Real-time Updates**
- Polling every 5 seconds for live data
- Automatic UI updates when data changes
- Error handling with user notifications

## 📋 Assumptions Made

1. **Backend API Structure**: Standard RESTful endpoints
2. **Room Types**: Limited to specified common room types (Gym, Library, Laundry)
3. **Temperature Range**: 10-40°C for safety
4. **Authentication**: Not implemented (not in requirements)
5. **Real-time**: Polling instead of WebSockets for simplicity

## 🧪 Testing

- Unit tests for main components
- API mocking for isolated testing
- Manual testing with backend integration
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- WebSocket integration for true real-time updates
- User authentication and role-based access
- Historical temperature data and charts
- Advanced scheduling features
- Offline mode support
- Push notifications for temperature alerts
